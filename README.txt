Final Project IAT 455 


Han Wu and Sam Kobe

We built a Generative Visual Art based of 
Flocking behaiver intepreter that we have built based on Artificial Intelligence concepts, such as DIKW Pyramid from Jennifer Rowley's paper in 2007  "The wisdom hierarchy: representations of the DIKW hierarchy"

We built a canvas layered system that uses 3 layers.
The third layer is a hidden canvas image that we pull imagData from and utilize at each boids position. This pixel data's color is then used to draw a larger shape in it's place that stylistically lowers the fidelity of the image.
